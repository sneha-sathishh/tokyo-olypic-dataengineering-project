I utilized Azure Data Factory, a data pipeline tool on the Azure platform, to extract data from the API and construct a data flow for the initial ingestion of raw data into Azure Data Lake Storage.
 Next, I harnessed Azure Databricks to craft Spark code, facilitating data transformations before loading the refined dataset back into Data Lake Storage. 
Finally, leveraging Synapse Analytics, I executed SQL queries to extract valuable insights from the transformed data.

The dataset utilized is Olympic data sourced from Kaggle, encompassing comprehensive information on athletes, coaches, medals, participating teams, and gender-related details.
